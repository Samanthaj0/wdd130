        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Samantha</h2>
        <p>Well hello! I am Samantha, but I am also not picky with names, and will almost always respond to a name that
            begins with Sa. I have no idea what I am doing for a career. I started completely positive about what I was
            doing and wanted to be on a path for physical therapy, but now I am floating so to speak. I love to spend
            time outside, or inside. It sort of just depends on my mood. My cousin has creative ideas to
            decribe my mood and energy swings. However, even when I am down, I like most things. However, I am a big fan
            of creating things. This could be baking, writing short stories, drawing really bad drawings, and more. I
            also love sports, but my favorite is softball. I started it when I was 8 and continued it until COVID shut
            us down my senior year. I get too competative when doing any sports, or playing Mario Cart.</p>
        <p>I am single, currently a nanny for my cousins and their ten month old baby,but that ends in a few weeks, so
            then we will see where I go from there. I may not have my own family started, but I come from a huge family,
            so I am definitely not lacking in that department. To clarify, my grandparents fell in love at first sight
            and married at sixteen, then had fifteen children together. their fifteen kids led to ninety-eight
            grandchildren, over two hundred and seventy great-granchildren, and before they passed away a few years ago,
            they had around twenty great-great-grandchildren. Family reunions were always at my parents house in Arizona
            because we had a big yard, and I wouldnt trade my big family for anything. In the past few years I have
            moved from Arizona to Idaho to Arizona to Wyoming and soon back to Idaho. Then I will have to see wher I go
            next, I find I have been staying close to my big family, which isn't difficult due to the size, but I do not
            foresee that changing anytime soon.</p>
        <p>I love the religion classes at this school. It is nice to have a constant connection to the gospel, even in
            the classes that are not centered on Christ. I know all of the classes are, but I mean the science or math
            classes, or this class. I also love the companionship I have found here, and the connection I feel to others
            at this school. It makes this all easier in this rough and often disconnected times that we are in. I signed
            up for this course wihtout knowing if it would lead to anything due to a lack of something to do,
            but I am already fascinated with it. I hope to learn a lot of helpful and interesting things in this class
            that I can apply to both personal and proffessional things in the future. I have been a member of the church
            since I was born, and have only grown more grateful for that as time
            passes.My favorite quote changes too frequently, but I love motivational and any uplifting quotes that I
            come by. My favorite scripture would be 1Nephi 3:7. I love Nephi's devotin and pull from it when I am
            lacking.<br>
